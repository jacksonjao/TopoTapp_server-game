# TopoTapp_server-game
workshop 1 - network programming class

TopoTapp was a 2D mini video game made for the network programming class, this mini game uses a desktop screen controlled by Android device, I programmed this video game on java using Processing library and Android SDK. TopoTapp was inspired in a game for a fair event and the Pok√©mon character Diglett.

to download the Android application go here "https://github.com/jacksonjao/TopoTapp_client-controller" it is important to download this because it is the game remote control.
